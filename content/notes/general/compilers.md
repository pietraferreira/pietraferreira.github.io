# Compilers
---
A compiler is a system that converts a program from one language to another. In the context of this course, we refer to a compiler as a program that converts a high-level language like C, C++ to a low-level language like assembly language or an executable format. Open source compilers like gcc and clang are commonly used to achieve this. These compilers are quite advanced. In a nutshell, they:

- Compile several high-level languages: C, C++, Fortran, Objective C, etc.
- Target several architectures: ARM, Aarch64, MIPS, RISC-V, WebAssembly, X86-64, etc.
- Optimise programs to run faster: Loop unrolling, inlining, vectorisation, etc.
- Provide linting and other software engineering capabilities: static analysis, warnings, etc.
- Provide APIs to be used by other source code introspection and transformation tools.
- Provide source code instrumentation capabilities for performance analysis, program introspection.

## Structure of a Compiler

## Languages for Writing Compilers
Possible approaches:

- Use assembly language.
- Use a high level language that is widely available.
- Use the source language itself.
    - Ultimate in portability, but not always suitable.
- Generalised assembly language.

Increasingly mainstream compilers use the **second** approach, with C++ now the language of choice (being ubiquitous (found everywhere)).
